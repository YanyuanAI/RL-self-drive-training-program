# RL-self-drive-training-program
Self-drive training simulation system based on Reinforcement Learning
This program use deep Q learning algorithm to tarin the self-drive car,so that the car can learn to steer its angel based on different situations.The simulation system used Unity to compelete the 3D environment,and saved image file every frame and translated to the controll algorithm.
